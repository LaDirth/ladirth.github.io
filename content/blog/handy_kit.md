Numerous pages exist about the equipment new beekeepers need to start beekeeping.  This isn't that list, its the items NOT listed on those lists that I found useful.

* A paint multi-tool can be used in place of a lost hive tool [example](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Warner-Pro-Grip-5-IN-1-2-25-in-Carbon-Steel-Paint-Multi-Tool/5003316973)
* Head sweatband(s).  Keeps the sweat out of your eyes when squinting at frames.
* Phone stylus: Useful for taking pictures on your phone, and easily lost, buy a multi-pack 
* EpiPen: In case of severe allergic reactions. 
* Equipment organization: Can be a toolbox, or just a bucket.  I use old cat litter buckets.
