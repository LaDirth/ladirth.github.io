# Feeding your bees

## Notes on Sugar Syrup

Following ratios fit in a 6 quart pot
* 2:1 is half a gallon of water to 8lbs of sugar
* 1:1 is half a gallon of water to 4lbs of sugar

Ratios are approximate, the bees don't mine 2.1:1 or 1.9:1 syrup.
1:1 equal parts water and sugar. 2:1 means twice the sugar to water

## Spring Feeding

Feeding 1:1 in the spring promotes comb production in spring.


## Winter Feeding
