Winterizing your hives, strong fall hives make strong spring hives.  Here are some notes on helping your hives survive the winter. 

* Combine weak hives
* Ensure at least 40lbs of honey for winter.
    * Full deep frame: 6lbs
    * Full medium frame: 3.5 lbs
    * **Beekeeping is local.  Ask a local beekeepers for hive overwintering needs.**
* Feed 2:1 sugar syrup to get your weight up to 40lbs.
    * Added weight is the sugar weight, not the total syrup weight.
    * A gallon of 2:1 is 8lbs of "weight" for feeding purposes.
* Put a paper plate with dry sugar.  
    * Sugar feeds and is hygroscopic (absorbs water)
* Put a piece of foam insulation on top of your hive with a brick on top.
    * Decreased condensation on the top dripping down onto the bees.
    * Excess condensation will happen on the sides of the hive, harmlessly flowing down the side and out of the hive.
