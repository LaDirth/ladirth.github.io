The Varroa Destructor mite is the bane of modern beekeeping.

Alcohol Wash Tips
* This IS fatal for bees, make sure you do not kill your queen!
* Use at least 70% isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol
* 1/2 cup of bees are around 300 bees
* Nurse and house bees are the best bees to use
* Goal is 1%-3% mites, or 3-9 mites per 300 bees
* Shake for 60 seconds to kill the bees/mites and separate them.
