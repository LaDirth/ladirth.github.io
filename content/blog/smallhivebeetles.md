Some ideas on how to manage small hive beetles.

* Peppermint candies have been shown to reduce small hive beetle populations.
* Unscented Swiffer sheets or felt strips in the top of the hive.
  * Small hive beetles get caught in the fabric and cannot move. 
* Use a grubicide under your hives.  Use a drop spreader to keep the grubicide from affecting the hives.
