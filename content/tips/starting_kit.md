A starting point, this is what I found was a minimum starter kit, other than the obvious. 

* A paint multi-tool can be used in place of a hive tool [example](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Warner-Pro-Grip-5-IN-1-2-25-in-Carbon-Steel-Paint-Multi-Tool/5003316973)
* Head sweatband(s).  Keeps the sweat out of your eyes when squinting at frames.
* Phone stylus, many: useful for taking pictures on your phone, and easily lost.
* EpiPen: In case of severe allergic reactions.
